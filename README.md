# Mobile-Price-Classification
This project is designed to help Bob, a new entrepreneur who started his mobile factory and designed different mobiles with different specifications. The project aims to train machine learning models and classify the prices of Bob's new devices using existing data from popular mobile brands such as Apple and Samsung.

# Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project has 21 attributes and 2000 observations. Each observation corresponds to a mobile device and includes features such as battery power, clock speed, RAM, internal memory, and more. The target variable is the price range of the device, which is divided into four categories (0, 1, 2, 3) representing different price ranges.

# Models Used and Respective Accuracies
Four machine learning models were used to classify the price range of the mobile devices in the dataset. The accuracies of each model are as follows:

1.Support Vector Machine: 98%

2.Random Forest: 90%

3.K-Nearest Neighbors: 93%

4.Decision Tree: 84%

# Results

The machine learning models were trained on the dataset, and their accuracies were evaluated using cross-validation. The best performing model was the Support Vector Machine with an accuracy of 98%.

# Next Steps

Here are some potential next steps to explore with this project:

Try using other machine learning algorithms and compare their performance with the existing models.
Collect more data to expand the dataset and potentially improve the models' accuracy.
Experiment with feature selection and feature engineering techniques to see if they can improve the models' performance.
